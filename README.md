# K8 local

This project has a bunch of shell scripts to install and configure kubernetes locally and with addition of kuberless framework to run lambda functions inside kubernetes and kubernetes dashboard.

## Setup & Installation

There is no secret. All files are self descriptive.

You can check each of them before run it.

You must set all .sh files as executable before. If you don't do that, you will face a message like the one bellow:

    'permission denied: ./file_name.sh'

 To do that just execute

    chmod +x file_name.sh

Once you do that, you can execute them like that:

    ./file_name.sh

## To Do:

I still want to add additional scripts so you can test different frameworks to handle lambda functions with kubernetes like fission, open fass and openwhisk.
